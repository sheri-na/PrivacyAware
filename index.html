  <p id= "regular-font">Data Privacy is the protection of personal data from unauthorized access, ensuring individuals retain control over who can access their information. With over half of the world's population now using the internet, safeguarding data privacy has become increasingly crucial.</p>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
    <h3>Trust Erosion</h3>
    <p>Persistent breaches of privacy erode trust between users and service providers and weaken confidence in online interactions and transactions. This erosion of trust extends beyond individual businesses and platforms, affecting the overall credibility of digital environments. It can lead to a decline in consumer confidence, reluctance to share personal information, and increased skepticism towards digital services, hindering the growth of e-commerce and online engagement. Rebuilding trust requires transparent communication, robust security measures, and swift, decisive action in addressing privacy breaches.</p>

    <h3> Discrimination</h3>
    <p>The exposure or misuse of sensitive information can perpetuate systemic discrimination and prejudice, exacerbating existing inequalities and hindering societal progress. <br></br>This risk heightens the extensive data collection capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT devices, interconnected with sensors and software, operate autonomously and exchange data over the internet. Without direct human intervention, these devices generate vast amounts of data across various domains, from household appliances to industrial machinery. <br></br>Similarly, traditional internet-connected devices like computers and smartphones, reliant on human interaction, are susceptible to the misuse of collected data, leading to discrimination. For example, data extracted from smartphones or computers, such as browsing history or location data, can be leveraged to profile individuals and influence biased decisions in employment, housing, healthcare, and other spheres. This misuse disproportionately affects marginalized groups, including racial minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and low-income communities, heightening their vulnerability to discrimination stemming from such data.

    <h2>Situation</h2>
      <img src = "img/head/1.svg "> 
      <p><strong>Increasing Data Collection:</strong> Rapid technological advancements have fueled a significant increase in personal data collection from various platforms, from social media platforms and smart devices to online services. This surge in data collection reflects the fact that 90% of the world's data was generated in the last two years alone. Experts project that in the next five years, global data collection will surpass 180 zettabytes, which equates to roughly one trillion gigabytes, equivalent to the storage capacity of billions of smartphones.</p>
      <p><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> High-profile data breaches have continued to rise over the years, reaching up to 97 victims per hour. These breaches expose the sensitive information of millions of individuals to unauthorized access and potential misuse by cybercriminals, underscoring the vulnerability of personal data stored by organizations.</p>
